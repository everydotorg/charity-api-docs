## Setting up your webhook

Please email us at [support@every.org](mailto:support@every.org) to set up a
Partner Webhook.

In your email, include:

- A couple sentences about your use case
- Your webhook endpoint

We will then send you a unique `webhook_token` which you can include as a
parameter on your [Donate Link](../donate-link.md). All donations that are made
via your Donate Link with your `webhook_token` will result in a notification
being sent to your webhook.
