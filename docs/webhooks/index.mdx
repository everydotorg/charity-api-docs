Every.org supports using webhooks to get notified when one of your donors
completes a donation. After you set up your webhook, we will make a `POST`
request to your webhook endpoint with information about the new donation.

Every.org webhooks come in two flavors - the
[Nonprofit Donation Webhook](./nonprofit-webhook.mdx) and the
[Partner webhook](./partner-webhook.mdx).

## Nonprofit Donation Webhook

The Nonprofit Donation Webhook enables nonprofit admins to get notified every
time a donation is made to their nonprofit.

[here](./nonprofit-webhook.mdx).

## Partner Webhook

The Partner Webhook enables developers using a [Donate Link](../donate-link.md)
to get notified every time a donation is completed via their link.

Read more about setting up a Partner Webhook [here](./partner-webhook.mdx).

## Data format

Requests made by both the Nonprofit Donation and Partner webhooks follow the
same format, minus a few fields.
