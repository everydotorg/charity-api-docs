**The nonprofit donation [webhook](https://www.getvero.com/resources/webhooks)
allows a nonprofit to be notified every time a donation is made.**

We will make a POST request to the specified webhook with information about the
donation every time a donation is completed\*. One common use case for setting
such a webhook is to create a custom integration between Every.org and a donor
CRM.

- Note: Some types of donations like bank or PayPal take a while to go through,
  so even if a webhook gets called, the donation may eventually fail.

## Setting up your webhook

You can set your webhook URL by editing your organization's profile at
`every.org/<organization-slug>/admin/edit`.
