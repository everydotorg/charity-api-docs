# Our Open APIs

## Nonprofit Search

The Nonprofit Search API allows you to incorporate search of over 1 million
501(c)(3) organizations into your website's API, get metadata about each
nonprofit, and create a donate link for others to quickly donate. See an example
of it in action at [givingmultiplier.org/](https://givingmultiplier.org/).

## Donate Button

The open-source Every.org Donate button provides a beautiful donation experience
so that you can accept donations for your nonprofit on your website immediately,
just by copying in a code snippet into your webpage.

## Donate Link

This documentation describes how to link to the donate flow for a nonprofit on
Every.org. The link includes parameters that you can use to pre-fill information
like donation amount and frequency. Other parameters let you control aspects of
the donation flow like whether a background shows up or if the donor should be
redirected back to your site after completing their gift.

# Webhooks

Webhooks enable you to get notified every time one of your donors completes a
donation. The Nonprofit Donation Webhook enables nonprofit admins to get
notified about donations to their nonprofit, while the Partner Webhook enables
developers to get notified about donations made via their
[Donate Link](./donate-link.md).
